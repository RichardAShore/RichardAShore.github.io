<h1>Logic seminar, Fall 2012</h1><br>



<br>
<br>

The topic for this semester will be computable model theory.
We will concentrate on the model theoretic rather than the sturcture theoretic one
in the sense that we will mostly start our invesitgations with theories and models 
given effectively with their full elementary diagram (decidable models). We will investigate classical 
model theoretic theorems and their effective content or the difficulty (say in terms of 
Turing degree) of extracting their content when it cannot be done effectively. Sample basic
notions to be investigated include completeness and compactness; classes of special models 
such as prime, atomic, homogeneous, universal and saturated; 
categorictiy (both countable and uncoultable) and related conditions. Issues dealing 
with recurisve models (i.e. only the atomic diagram is recursive) may be considered as time 
permits and opportunities arise.

Tuesday, 8/28: <i>Recursive Presentations of Trichotomous Strongly Minimal Models </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Uri Andrews</strong>,  University of Wisconsin, Madison <br>


Abstract: For an uncountably categorical theory T, the spectrum of
recursive models of T (SRM(T)) describes the dimensions of models of T
with recursive copies. I will show that if T is a base example of a
theory satisfying the Zilber trichotomy and has finite signature, then
either all models of T are recursive, no models or T are recursive, or
only the prime model of T is recursive. (Joint with Alice Medvedev.)

<br><br><br>

Wednesday, 8/29: <i>Spectra of Theories</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Uri Andrews</strong>,  University of Wisconsin, Madison <br>

Abstract: For a structure A, the spectrum is the set of Turing degrees
of isomorphic copies of A. For a complete elementary first order
theory T, the spectrum is the set of Turing degrees of models of T. We
will compare these notions, in particular showing that there are
theory spectra which are not structure spectra and vice versa. We will
also discuss what's known about the relationship between the spectrum
of T and the model theoretic properties of T. (Joint with Joseph S.
Miller and Julia F. Knight)

There will be a dinner with the speaker Wednesday evening, 6:00 pm at Thai Cusine.

Tuesday, 9/4: <i> Computable Structure Theory and Uncountable Linear Orders
</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Asher Kach</strong>, University of Chicago <br>
 <br>
Abstract: Though countable linear orders are fairly well understood in the
effective setting, the study of uncountable linear orders in the effective
setting is rather recent.  After motivating and introducing computability
theory within the context of larger domains, we will compare and contrast the
computable structure theory of countable and uncountable (mainly size
$\aleph_1$) linear orders. In particular, we will discuss computable
categoricity, degree spectra, and external relations (such as the successor,
infinitely-far-apart, and uncountably-far-apart relations).

This work is joint with Noam Greenberg, Steffen Lempp, and Daniel Turetsky.

Wednesday, 9/5: <i>It's All Relative, Except When It's Not: Categoricity
versus Relative Categoricity</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Asher Kach</strong>, University of Chicago<br>
  <br>
Abstract: The notions of computable categoricity and
relative computable categoricity (also their relativizations) are both
rather similar and rather different.  In this talk, we attempt to
develop both themes, though much of the evidence will point to these
notions being rather different.  As part of this analysis, we resolve
the index set complexity of the computably categorical structures,
showing that it is $\Pi^1_1$-complete.

This work is joint with some of and all of Rodney Downey, Steffen
Lempp, Andrew Lewis, Antonio Montalban, and Daniel Turetsky.

Tuesday, 9/11: <i>Reverse Recursion Theory and d-r.e. Degrees</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong> Li Wei</strong>,
National University of Singapore and Cornell University
<br>
Abstract: In this talk, we will review some background and history of
Reverse Recursion Theory and talk about some results of d-r.e. degrees in
that theory. We will show that \Sigma_1 Collection, which is strictly weaker
than \Sigma_1 Induction, is sufficient for the existence of proper d-r.e.
but interestingly, \Sigma_1 Induction is necessary for the existence of
proper d-r.e. degrees below 0'. Moreover, we will show that in some model of
\Sigma_1 Collection without \Sigma_1 Induction, every degree below 0' is
r.e.

Wednesday, 9/12: <i> Recursive Model Theory, An Introduction</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Richard A. Shore</strong>,  Cornell University<br><br>

<br><br>

Tuesday, 9/18: <i>Idempotent measures on binary systems</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Justin Moore</strong>, Cornell University<br><br>
<b>Note this talk will be in 5th floor lounge.</b><br><br>
Abstract:  I will demonstrate how to construct a finitely additive
probability measure $\mu$ on the free binary system on one generator such
that $\mu * \mu = \mu$, where $*$ denotes the extension of the groupoid
operation to the space of measures by convolution.  As an immediate
collary we will obtain a proof that Thompson's group F is amenable.

Tuesday, 10/30: <i>Comparing the Complexity of Unstable Theories</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Maryanthe Malliaris</strong>, University of Chicago<br>
<br><br>
Abstract:
Model theory brings a unique and powerful point of view to bear on many
fundamental structural questions in mathematics. This talk will have two
interrelated aims. The first is to motivate and present some recent progress
of Malliaris on Keisler's order: a suggested program of comparing the
complexity of theories from asymptotic (ultrapower) points of view. These
results, the first in decades in this program, build towards a true
classification of the unstable theories. The stable theories have been well
understood thanks to work of Morley and to Shelah's significant
generalizations of Morley's work.
<br>
The second is to indicate how our work arising from this model theoretic
program has led to theorems in Szemeredi regularity and in set theory and
general topology. Cantor proved in 1874 that the continuum is uncountable,
and Hilbert's first problem asked whether it is the smallest uncountable
cardinal. A program developed to measure the continuum in terms of various
related cardinals. By Godel 1939 and Cohen 1963, Hilbert's first problem was
proved independent of ZFC. However, several basic questions about these
cardinal invariants of the continuum remained open despite much
investigation. The oldest of these is whether "p = t", proved in a special
case by Rothberger 1948, building on Hausdorff 1934. Very recently,
Malliaris and Shelah resolved this question, in a surprising way, using
model-theoretic tools developed for the study of Keisler's order.

We will take the speaker to dinner after the seminar.

Wednesday, 10/31: <i>Canonization of Borel equivalence relations</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Marcin Sabok</strong>,  Instytut 
Matematyczny Uniwersytetu Wroc and 
Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk<br> 
<br>
Abstract:
I will discuss some recent developments in canonical Ramsey theory in
the context of descriptive set theory. I will survey canonization
results for various classes of equivalence relations. I will show that
hypersmooth equivalence relations canonize to three equivalences: two
trivial ones and $E_1$. I will also show that equivalence relations
reducible to $E_2$ also canonize to three equivalences: the two
trivial ones and $E_2$.
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the talk.
<br><br>

Tuesday, 11/6: <i>Recent progress in parameterized upper and lower bounds</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Rod Downey</strong>, Victoria University of Wellington<br>
<br>

Abstract:
<br>
The focus of parameters has delivered tools to the algorithm designers such
as kernelization, iterative compression, bounded nondeterminism techniques,
color coding, and logical metatheorems. It also has delivered a
classification hierarchy of hardness cores based on aspects of logical
depth.
<br>
Remarkably, in the last decade there has been a matching of upper and lower
bound results, more or less up to big-O factors for a number of problems
based on complexity assumptions like ETH. There has also been progress
showing that certain techniques such as kernelization cannot be used for to
give optimal running times for problems, in spite of the fact that FPT is
the same as kernelizability.
<br>
This talk will look at some of these developments.

<br>There will be a dinner with the speaker after the talk.

Wednesday, 11/7: <i>The computability theory of the Finite Intersection Principle
</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Rod Downey</strong>,  Victoria University of Wellington<br> 
<br>
Abstract: 
<br>
A family of sets ${\mathcal F}=\{A_i\mid i\in J\}$ has FIP iff for any
finite $I\subset J$, $\cap_{i\in I}A_i\ne \emptyset.$ The FIP principle says
that any collection of sets has a maximal subcollection with FIP. The
reverse maths and effective content of this principle, classically
equivalent to choice, was initiated by Dzharfarov and Mummert. They showed,
for instance, that there is a computable family with no computable maximal
FIP subfamily. We say that a degree ${\bf a}$ is FIP iff it has the ability
to compute a solution to any computable instance of FIP. Dzharfarov and
Mummert's result says that ${\bf 0}$ is \emph{not} FIP. Dzharfarov and
Mummert showed that each nonzero c.e.\ degree is FIP, all FIP degrees are
hyperimmune, and several classes of 1-generics degree were FIP.
<br>
We extend these investigations by giving new (shorter) proofs of some of
Dzharfarov and Mummert's work, and also showing that all 1-generics are FIP,
and showing that, for the $\Delta_2^0$ degrees, that the FIP degrees are
precisely the ones that bound 1-generic degrees. We could hope that this
characterization extends to the general hyperimmune case, since hyperimmune
degrees resemble $\Delta^0_2 $ ones. However, we can also show that there is
a minimal $\Delta_3^0$ FIP degree. This last result has some technical
complexity as it is a full approximation argument constructing a hyperimmune
$\Delta_3^0$ degree, which does not seem to have occurred in the literature
hitherto.
