Wednesday, 2/23: <i> Diagonal Stationary Reflection and Generic Ultrapowers</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong> Sean Cox, </strong>, Muenster University<br>

Abstract:
I will introduce various versions of the Diagonal Reflection Principle (DRP).
These are highly simultaneous kinds of stationary set reflection that follow
from strong forcing axioms like MM and $MA^{+\omega_1}(\sigma-closed)$. I will
also discuss the effect of DRP on generic ultrapowers.

Tuesday, 3/29: <i> Algorithmic independence and PA Degrees</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jan Reimann </strong>, Pennsylvania State University<br>

Abstract:<br>
In joint work with Adam Day, we study the question of when two reals
A,B are independent with respect to their mutual information. 
We interpret the question rather qualitatively
and ask whether there exists a probability measure mu such that A and
B are relatively mu-random. We prove a general version of Van
Lambalgen's Theorem and use it reduce the question to randomness for
product measures. We will exhibit rather strong obstacles for r.e.
sets to be random for product measures, and apply it to obtain results
on PA degrees.

Wednesday, 3/30: <i> Lowness properties [5.1] </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Mingzhong Cai</strong>, Cornell University<br>

<br><br>

Tuesday, 4/5: <i> Sahlqvist's theorem for modal fixed point logic</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Nick Bezhanishvili</strong>, Department 
of Computing, Imperial College London<br>

<br>
Abstract:

Modal fixed point logic is an extension of modal logic with least
and greatest fixed point operators. It is decidable, with reasonable
complexity, yet very expressive: many widely used modal and temporal
logics embed in it as fragments.
However, the issue of completeness for fixed point logic for the
standard Kripke semantics turned out to be very problematic.<br>

In this talk, I will illustrate how to remedy this problem using the
semantics of admissible assignments. This new semantics also admits an
order-topological representation via ordered Stone spaces. I will present a
fixed point analogue of Sahlqvist's theorem - a well-known result of
modal logic,
and discuss the potential of admissible semantics as an alternative
foundation
for modal fixed point logic.

This is joint work with Ian Hodkinson.

Wednesday, 4/13: <i> Well quasi-ordering Aronszajn lines </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Carlos Martinez</strong>, University of Toronto<br>

Abstract: We show that, assuming PFA, the class of Aronszajn lines is well
quasi-ordered by embeddability.
