<h1>Logic seminar 
<br>
Fall 2015</h1><br>



<br>
<br>

The topic for this semester will be (computable) infinitary languages,
(effective) structure theory  and forcing. I expect to use recent notes
by Julia Knight as a starting point: The hyperarithmetical  hierarchy
and computable structure theory. I will distribute a pdf copy of these
notes by email. 
 Her text with Ash is also a source for some of the
material and available through the Cornell Library:

 <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.cornell.
edu/science/bookseries/0049237X/144">Computable Structures and the Hyperarithmetical Hierarchy</a>
<br><br>

Also useful for the  review of (or introduction to) the basics of constructive ordinals 
and hyperarithmetic sets is the text used three semesters ago:

<br><br>
<a href="http://projecteuclid.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/euclid.pl/1235422631">
Higher Recursion Theory</a>, G. E. Sacks. 
<br><br>

 We will begin with a review of (or introduction to) the basics of constructive ordinals 
and hyperarithmetic sets needed to formulate and work with computable
infinitary languages. We will  then move on to applications to
computable structure theory with an emphasis on forcing with such
languages as a tool. With luck we will see some applications of using
some of these languages as  the language of forcing along with a
variety of forcing notions can be used to prove results in other areas as well.

Tuesday, 9/1: <i>Robust Reflection Properties</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong> Chris Lambie-Hanson</strong>,  Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem <br>
<br>

Abstract: 
<br><br>
Large cardinals are useful in set theory in part because they imply certain 
reflection properties. For example, if $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, 
then $\kappa$ satisfies the tree property and every stationary subset of $\kappa$ reflects. 
An interesting direction of research involves investigating the extent to which these 
reflection properties can hold at smaller cardinals. 
By results of Levy and Solovay, for most large cardinal notions (inaccessible, weakly compact, 
measurable, etc.), if $\kappa$ is such a large cardinal in $V$ and $\mathbb{P}$ is a 
forcing poset such that $|\mathbb{P}| < \kappa$, then $\kappa$ remains large in the 
forcing extension $V^{\mathbb{P}}$. Therefore, reflection properties of a cardinal $\kappa$ 
that are implied by $\kappa$ being a particular large cardinal are themselves 
indestructible by small forcing when $\kappa$ is such a large cardinal. 
However, these reflection properties may no longer be indestructible at $\kappa$ if 
$\kappa$ is a small cardinal. For example, it is consistent that $\aleph_{\omega+1}$ has 
the tree property but there is $\mathbb{P}$ with $|\mathbb{P}| = \aleph_1$ such that 
$\aleph_{\omega+1}$ fails to have the tree property in $V^{\mathbb{P}}$. 
<br><br>
We will begin by reviewing the relevant large cardinal and reflection notions and will 
then consider strengthenings of certain reflection properties that are always 
indestructible under small forcing, focusing in particular on stationary reflection 
and the tree property. We will look at the extent to which these reflection properties 
can hold at small cardinals and the extent to which they are in fact stronger than 
the weaker principles from which they are derived.

Tuesday, 9/8: <i>Forcings in arithmetic which preserve complexity of sets I</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>,  Cornell University  <br><br>
Abstract: The forcings for constructing paths on infinite binary trees,
cohesive sets for arrays, and infinite transitive subsets of tournaments,
all preserve complexity of sets. That is, sets which are complex relative
to the ground model remain complex relative to the extension. Here, complex
could mean $\Delta^0_2$ (Wang 2014) or hyperimmune (Patey 2015). We present
their proofs and mention applications to reverse mathematics.

Wednesday, 9/9: <i>Recurisve and constructive ordinals: Kleene's O (Ch. 2)</i><br>

<br><br>

Tuesday, 9/15: <i>Strong Homology and Set Theory
</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jeff Bergfalk</strong>, Cornell University <br>

<br>
Abstract: We continue to explore the sensitivity of the additivity of
strong homology to set-theoretic assumptions. This sensitivity centers on
the behavior of the higher derived limits of an inverse system A. We'll
review definitions of this system and those limits, and discuss two main
results: 1. Under PFA, strong homology is not additive; 2. lim^1 A=0 if and
only if lim^1 X=0 for all X in a much wider class of inverse systems.<br>

<br><strong>3:30-4:30 Malott 230 </strong><br><br>
Tuesday, 9/22: <i>Automatic Sequences and Curves over Finite Fields</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Andrew Bridy</strong>,  University of Rochester<br>

<br><br>
Abstract: A theorem of Christol states that a power series y over a finite field is
an algebraic function if and only if its coefficient sequence can be produced by a
finite automaton, which is a limited model of a computer
with no memory. The proof uses combinatorics and linear algebra, but hidden in the
theorem there is geometric information about a curve that contains y in its function
field. I make this explicit by demonstrating a precise
link between the complexity of the automaton and the geometry of the curve.
<br><br>
The talk should include "a gentle introduction to automata and their 
connection to algebra."

Tuesday, 10/20: <i>Reverse mathematics and the ascending chain condition</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Stephen Simpson</strong>,  Pennsyvlanua State University <br><br>
<br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the talk.
<br><br>
Abstract: Reverse mathematics seeks to classify core-mathematical
theorems up to logical equivalence.  In this talk we discuss some
results to the effect that certain algebraic theorems are
reverse-mathematically equivalent to the well-orderedness of certain
ordinal numbers.  Let omega_n denote the ordinal number consisting of
a stack of omegas of height n. A long time ago I showed that the
Hilbert Basis Theorem (1890: "every ideal in a polynomial ring is
finitely generated") is equivalent to well-orderedness of omega_2,
hence not finitistically reducible in the sense of Hilbert's Program
in the foundations of mathematics.  This reverse-mathematical result
supports Gordan's famous remark to the effect that the Hilbert Basis
Theorem is not mathematics but theology.  Some related theorems due to
Robson and MacLagen are known to be even more theological, in that
they are equivalent to well-orderedness of omega_3.  Let K[S] denote
the group ring of the infinite symmetric group S.  A 1978 theorem of
Formanek and Lawrence says that the 2-sided ideals of K[S] satisfy the
ascending chain condition.  Recently Hatzikiriakou and I used b.q.o.
theory to show that these same ideals satisfy the antichain condition.
For these ideals we show that the ascending chain condition is
equivalent to well-orderedness of omega_2, but the status of the
antichain condition remains as an open question.

Tuesday, 11/3: <i>Encoding-Free Foundations</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Scott Messick</strong>,  Cornell University<br><br>

Abstract: Foundational systems are by nature adequate in principle for
formalizing a large body (if not all) of informal mathematical
knowledge.  However, the formalizations usually proceed by means of
various encodings, which may be adequate for some mathematical purposes
but not very faithful semantically or readable to a human being.  For
example, what does the formalization of the definition of a Lie group
look like?  Is it recognizable as such?  I will exhibit a system which
is designed from the ground up to be give rise to simple, readable
formalizations that minimize encoding overhead.  The goal is to show
that not only is it possible to do this, but it is possible to do so
with only a few very simple primitives.  The system bears some
resemblance to, and is partly inspired by, constructive type theories
such as that of Martin-Löf, NUPRL's type theory, homotopy type theory,
and the calculus of inductive constructions (which is used by Coq).  I
will illustrate the use of the system by formalizing a few basic
theorems, and discuss the possible applications of the approach, and its
drawbacks.  This work is preliminary and I am eager to solicit feedback
from other logicians, so I will leave plenty of time at the end for
questions, discussion, and criticism.

Wednesday, 11/4: <i>Scott Ranks and some equivalents</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>, Cornell University <br>
<br><br>

Tuesday, 11/10: <i>The strength of RT^1_k </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Damir Dzhafarov</strong>, University of Connecticut, Storrs<br><br>

Abstract: The principle RT^1_k states that given any partition of \omega into k parts,
at least one part must be infinite. Of course, this is a very weak statement, and for
every (standard) k it is provable in the fragment RCA_0 of second-order arithmetic. In
this sense, it is provable from every other principle one considers in reverse
mathematics. If we move from proof theory to computability, and compare principles under
computability-theoretic reducibilities rather than under provability over RCA_0, things
become more interesting. I will review several such reducibilities, focusing on strong
computable (sc) and Weihrauch (W) reducibilities, and survey some examples. I will then
outline a recent result (jointly with Patey, Solomon, and Westrick) that for k > l,
RT^1_k is not sc-reducible to SRT^2_l. This answers a question of Hirschfeldt and
Jockusch. The proof is a forcing argument using the tree labeling method, a new
technique of building homogeneous sets for stable colorings, which I will describe.
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the talk.

<br><br>
Wednesday, 11/11: <i>Admissible Sets</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jeff Bergfalk</strong>, Cornell University <br>
<br><br>

Tuesday, 11/17: <i>The Complexity of Topological Conjugacy of Pointed Cantor Minimal Systems </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Burak Kaya</strong>, Rutgers University<br><br>
<br><br>

Abstract:
In this talk, we analyze the Borel complexity of topological conjugacy of pointed Cantor
minimal systems. We prove that the topological conjugacy relation on pointed Cantor
minimal systems is Borel bireducible with the Borel
equivalence relation $E_{cntble}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ defined by $x E_{cntble}
y \Leftrightarrow \{x_i:i \in \mathbb{N}\}=\{y_i:i \in \mathbb{N}\}$. We also show that
$E_{cntble}$ is a lower bound for the Borel complexity
of topological conjugacy of Cantor minimal systems. As an application of the former
result, we will show that there exists no equivalence-invariant Borel way of attaching
orders to simple Bratteli diagrams and obtaining properly
ordered Bratteli diagrams.

Wednesday, 11/18: <i>Polish groupoids and the classification problem for 
operator algebraic varieties </i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Martino Lupino</strong>, California Institute of Technology <br>
<br><br>
Abstract: <br>
I will explain how Hjorth's theory of turbulence can be generalized from Polish group
actions to Polish groupoids. As an application, I will present the proof that the
multiplier algebras of operator algebraic varieties are not classifiable up to
isomorphism by countable structures. This is joint work with Michael Hartz. No previous
knowledge in operator algebras will be assumed.
<br><br>
Note that Martino will also be speaking in the Olover Club on Thursday 11/19.
