My major research interests have centered around analyzing the structures of
relative complexity of computation of functions on the natural numbers. The
primary measure of such complexity is given by Turing reducibility: $f$ is
easier to compute than $g$, $f\leq _{T}g$, if there is a (Turing) machine
which can compute $f$ if it is given access to the values of $g$. I have
also worked with various other interesting measures of such complexity that
are defined by restricting the resources available primarily in terms of
access to $g$. The general thrust of my work has been to show that these
structures are as complicated as possible both algebraically and logically
(in terms of the complexity of the decision problems for their theories).
These results also allow one to differentiate among different notions of
relative complexity in terms of the orderings they define. Another major
theme in my work has been the relationship between these notions of
computational complexity and ones based on the difficulty of defining
functions in arithmetic. Restricting the computational resources more
directly in terms of time or space leads out of recursion theory and into
complexity theory. Relaxing the restrictions by allowing various infinitary
procedures leads instead into generalized recursion theory or set theory.
The methods developed in these investigations are also useful in determining
the effective content of standard mathematical theorems (when can existence
proofs be made effective) and the inherent difficulty of combinatorial
theorems in proof theoretic terms. Recently, I have also been working on
issues in effective model theory and algebra connected with the problem of
how the computational properties of algebraic structures can vary with
different (but always computable) presentations of the models.
