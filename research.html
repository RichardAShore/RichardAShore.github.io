My major research interests have centered around analyzing the structures of
relative complexity of computation of functions on the natural numbers. The
primary measure of such complexity is given by Turing reducibility: <i>f</i> is 
easier to compute than <i>g</i>, <i>f <u><</u><sub><small>T</small></sub> g</i>, if
there is a (Turing) machine which can compute <i>f</i> if it is given access to the
values of <i>g</i>.  I have also worked with various other interesting measures of
such complexity that are defined by restricting the resources available primarily 
in terms of access to <i>g</i>. The general thrust of my work has been to show that 
these structures are as complicated as possible both algebraically and logically 
(in terms of the complexity of the decision problems for their theories). These 
results also allow one to differentiate among different notions of relative 
complexity in terms of the orderings they define. Another major theme in my work 
has been the relationship between these notions of computational complexity and 
ones based on the difficulty of defining functions in arithmetic. Restricting the 
computational resources more directly in terms of time or space leads out of 
recursion theory and into complexity theory. Relaxing the restrictions by allowing 
various infinitary procedures leads instead into generalized recursion theory 
or set theory. The methods developed in these investigations are also useful 
in determining the effective content of standard mathematical theorems (when 
can existence proofs be made effective) and the inherent difficulty of 
combinatorial theorems in proof theoretic terms.
