<h1>Logic seminar 
<br>
Fall 2016</h1><br>



<br>
<br>

The topic for this semester will be computable reducibilities and Ramsey type combinatorial principles.
This is a relatively new approach (at least in the recursion theory and reverse mathematics communities) to 
the fundamental question of classifying the computational complexity of combinatorial problems. The older 
recursion theoretic approaches typically asked for characterizations of the (smallest) Turing degrees 
containing solutions to given combinatorial problems. The reverse mathematical point of view asked, given 
solutions to all instances of one such problems, what other problems can be solved over some weak base 
theory (or recursively, arithmetically, etc.).
<br><br>
The approach we will study this semester asks (usually) finer questions attempting to get at the 
method of going from the solution of 
some problem to that of another. For example, given two Pi^1_2 statements P and Q, we say that P is 
uniformly comptuably reducible to Q if there are two recursive procedures such that, given an instance of P,
the first procedure computes and instance of Q and the second computes a solution to the given 
instance of P from any 
solution to the computed instance of Q (together with the given instance of P). There are a number of 
variations. Some of them tackle, for example. the issues of how many times one needs to use a given 
principle P (or more than one) to find a solution for a given instance of Q. An interesting sidelight is 
that there was a substantial history of approaches to related problems in constructive analysis some 
of which (e.g. 
Weihrauch reducibilities) turned out to be equivalent to ones recently independently investigated in the 
computable approach. There are now some interesting interaction between the two approaches and communities.

Tuesday, 8/30: <i>Effective analysis of a combinatorial problem using the
probabilistic method I</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong> Carl Jockusch</strong>,  Universtiy of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign <br>
<br>

<br><br>
Abstract:Hindman's Theorem asserts that whenever the natural numbers are
colored with finitely many numbers there is an infinite set   A  of natural
numbers such that all finite nonempty sums of distinct elements of   A
have the same color.  I will discuss joint work with Barbara Csima, Damir
Dzhafarov, Denis Hirschfeldt, Reed Solomon, and Linda Westrick in which we
consider the effective analysis of a very special case of Hindman's Theorem
where only sums of length exactly two are considered.    This is
simultaneously a special case of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs.   Our main
result is that there is a computable 2-coloring of the natural numbers such
that there is no infinite  Sigma02 set  A   such that all sums   a + b
with a, b distinct elements of   A   have the same color.   The proof is
based on the paper "Probabilistic constructions of computable objects and a
computable version of Lov\'asz Local Lemma" by Andrei Rumyantsev and
Alexander Shen.    I will give an overview of this paper and will not
assume that those in attendance are already familiar with the probabilistic
method.

<br><br>

Tuesday, 9/13: <i>The uniform content of partial and linear orders</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Damir Dzhafarov</strong>, University of Connecticut, Storrs<br>

<br>
Abstract: The principle ADS asserts that every linear order on omega has an infinite
ascending or descending sequence. This has been studied extensively in the reverse
mathematics literature, beginning with the work of Hirschfeldt and Shore. I will
discuss recent joint work with Astor, Solomon, and Suggs looking at these principles
under Weihrauch (uniform) reducibility. For instance, we introduce the principle ADC,
which asserts that every such linear order has an infinite ascending or descending
chain. This is easily seen to be equivalent to ADS over RCA_0 (even computably
equivalent) but we show that ADC is strictly weaker than ADS under Weihrauch
reducibility. In fact, we show that even the principle SADS, which is the restriction
of ADS to linear orders of type ω + ω∗, is not Weihrauch reducible to ADC. In
this connection, we define a more natural stable form of ADS that we call
General-SADS, which is the restriction of ADS to linear orders of type k+ω, ω+ω∗, or
ω+k, where k is a finite number. We define General-SADC analogously. We prove that
General-SADC is not Weihrauch reducible to SADS, and so in particular, each of SADS
and SADC is strictly weaker under Weihrauch reducibility than its general version.
Finally, we turn to the principle CAC, which asserts that every partial order on ω has
an infinite chain or antichain. This has two previously studied stable variants, SCAC
and WSCAC, which were introduced by Hirschfeldt and Jockusch, and by Jockusch,
Kastermans, Lempp, Lerman, and Solomon, respectively, and which are known to be
equivalent over RCA0. Here, we show that SCAC is strictly weaker than WSCAC under even
computable reducibility.<br>

<br>


Wednesday, 9/14: <i>Ramsey’s theorem for singletons and strong computable reducibility
</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Damir Dzhafarov</strong>, University of Connecticut, Storrs<br>
<br>
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in looking at various forms of
Ramsey’s theorem under so-called strong reducibility, where P is said to be strongly
computably (sc) reducible to Q if, for each P-instance X, there is a Q-instance Y
computable from X, such that every Q-solution to Y computes a P-solution to X. (The
different from computable reduction is that the backward reduction is from the
P-solution alone, rather than from it join the original P-instance X.) As an early
result in this direction, I showed that COH is not sc-reducible to D^2_k for any k. In
this talk, I will give a proof, joint with Patey, Solomon, and Westrick, that Ramsey’s
theorem for singletons and k colors (RT^1_k) is not strongly computably reducible to
the stable Ramsey’s theorem for pairs and l colors (SRT^2_l) whenever k > l. This
answers a question of Hirschfeldt and Jockusch, and gives as a corollary a
considerable improvement over my prior result: namely, it follow that COH is not
sc-reducible even to SRT^2_k for any k. The proof of the main theorem is a rather
unusual forcing argument, involving a new combinatorial technique called tree
labeling. I will aim to give all the details.<br>
<br>

There will be a dinner with the speaker, probably at taste of Thai.

<br><br>

Tuesday, 9/20: <i>On the non-existence and definability of mad families</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Haim Horowitz</strong>,  Hebrew University of Jerusalem<br>

<br><br>
Abstract: By an old result of Mathias, there are no mad families in the Solovay model
constructed by the Levy collapse of a Mahlo cardinal. By a recent result
of Törnquist, the same is true in the classical model of Solovay as well.
In a recent paper, we show that ZF+DC+"there are no mad families" is
actually equiconsistent with ZFC. I'll present the ideas behind the proof
in the first part of the talk.
<br><br>
In the second part of the talk, I'll discuss the definability of maximal
eventually different families and maximal cofinitary groups. In sharp
contrast with mad families, it turns out that Borel MED families and MCGs
can be constructed in ZF. Finally, I'll present a general problem in Borel
combinatorics whose solution should explain the above difference
between mad and maximal eventually different families, and I'll show how
large cardinals must be involved in such a solution.
This is joint work with Saharon Shelah.
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker at Mehak, 6:00.
<br><br>
Wednesday, 9/21: <i>Uniform relations between combinatorial problem II</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jamie Barnes</strong>,  Cornell University <br>
<br><br>


Tuesday, 9/27: <i>Complete combinatorics for forcing with vector subspaces</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Iian Smythe</strong>,  Cornell University 
<br><br>
Abstract: We study the notion of forcing given by infinite-dimensional
block subspaces of a countably infinite-dimensional rational vector space.
We show that "strategic (p+)-filters" are L(R)-generic for this notion of
forcing, under large cardinal hypotheses. This comprises part of a "local
Ramsey theory" for block subspaces of vector spaces and is analogous to a
result of Todorcevic for selective ultrafilters on the natural numbers.<br><br>

Wednesday, 9/28: <i>Weihrauch reductions between Koenig's lemma and versions of Ramsey's
theorem</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>,  Cornell University 
<br><br>
Abstract: I will state and prove results of Hirschfeldt and Jockusch
relating the uniform computational strength of Koenig's lemma, RT^3_2, and
SRT^2_2, among others.

<br><br>
Tuesday, 10/4: <i> On the interplay between Nonstandard Analysis and computability theory</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Sam Sanders</strong>,  Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy <br>
<br>
Abstract: We survey recent results on the connection between Nonstandard Analysis (NSA) and
computability theory.
We present a number of negative and positive results and how they translate back and
forth between NSA and computability theory.
Of particular interest is how a negative result regarding the axioms of NSA (namely
'Transfer =/=> Standardization') gives rise to two
fundamentally different paths from second-order to higher-order mathematics (and the
associated notions of computability).
<br><br>

Wednesday, 10/5: <i>The unreasonable effectiveness of Nonstandard Analysis</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Sam Sanders</strong>, Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy <br>
<br>
Abstract: Nonstandard Analysis (NSA) was introduced around 1965 by Robinson as a formalization
of the intuitive infinitesimal calculus which is in use to date
in most of physics and historically in mathematics until the advent of Weierstrass’
epsilon-delta framework.  Famous people like Connes and Bishop
have derided NSA for its alleged utter lack of computational/effective/constructive
content.  In this talk I show that every theorem of ‘pure’ NSA
can be (equivalently) converted to a theorem of computable mathematics.  In many
cases, the resulting theorem is even constructive in the sense of Bishop.
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker at Mia's, 6:00.
<br><br>


Tuesday, 10/11: <i>No Seminar - Fall Break</i> 
<br><br>

Wednesday, 10/12: <i>No Seminar </i> 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Tuesday, 10/18: <i>Recovering smooth curves from their Jacobians in characteristic p</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Romin Abdolahzadi</strong>,  Cornell University <br><br>
Asrtact: In the early 1970s, Borel and Tits proved that if two simple algebraic
groups overs algebraically closed fields can be shown to be abstractly
isomorphic as groups, then the isomorphism yields an isomorphism of their
underlying algebraically closed fields which in turn yields an isogeny, or
'near isomorphism', between the algebraic groups. What this means is that
the algebra determines the geometry for simple algebraic groups: from the
group structure, one can recover most, if not all, of the geometric
structure. This same ideology has been prevalent in various parts of
algebraic geometry, and I will present one such instance of its appearance
within anabelian geometry.
<br><br>
In 2008, Bogomolov, Tschinkel, and Korotiaev prove that if C, C' are two
smooth projective bar{F_p}-curves of genus two or greater, the existence of
an abstract group isomorphism between their associated Jacobian abelian
varieties yields an isogeny between J and J'. They further conjectured that
under the aforementioned assumptions, C and C' are isomorphic as varieties
modulo a Frobenius twisting. I will show you a proof of their conjecture
given by Boris Zilber via E.D. Rabinovich's theorem: assume that M is a
strongly minimal structure definable in an algebraically closed field K,
and assume that the universe of M is some rational K-curve. Then if M is
not locally modular there exists a field F interpretable within M that is
isomorphic to K.<br>

<br>
Wednesday, 10/19:<i>Generalized uniform reducibiities: the reduction game</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>, Cornell University <br><br>
Abstract: I plan to introduce the reduction game of Hischfeldt and Jockusch and prove that
RT12 is not generalized Weihrauch reducible to COH. Time permitting, I will 
prove the generalization about undiagonalizable principles and principles
with diagonalization opportunities with some applications.

<br><br>

<br>
Tuesday, 10/25: <i>Encoding-Free Foundations, Continued</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Scott Messick</strong> <br>
<br>
Abstract: I will present work in progress on a new foundational system
for mathematics.  The system is designed to make actual formalization of
math--math fully written out in formal syntax--as pleasant as possible
for human beings to read and write.  The system involves juxtaposing
ideas from the untyped lambda calculus and from set theory, along with a
novel intermediating concept--definiteness--to ensure that "good"
constructions are easy to carry out, while "bad" (paradoxical)
constructions are illegal.  I will demonstrate that the system is
adequate for straightforwardly formalizing almost all of ordinary
mathematics.  However, I do not know whether the system is consistent. 
Skepticism is encouraged.
<br><br>
Wednesday, 10/26: <i>Generalized uniform reducibilities: counting instances</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>, Cornell University 
<br>
<br>
Abstract: I will give examples of principles P and Q such that P is
Weihrauch reducible to n, but not n-1, successive instances of Q. I will
then compare Hirschfeldt and Jockusch's reduction game with the bullet
operation defined by Dorais et al.
<br><br><br>

Tuesday, 11/1: <i> Bases for Aronszajn trees</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Hossein Lamei Ramandi</strong>, Cornell University<br><br>
Abstract: We prove that CH  is consistent with no
Aronszajn tree has a base of cardinality \aleph_1. This answers a question due to
Baumgartner. 
<br>
<br>

Wednesday, 11/2: <i>Infinite Ramsey theory and monoid actions</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Slawek Solecki</strong>, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
<br><br>
Abstract: We consider actions of finite monoids on left topological compact
semigroups by continuous 
endomorphisms. Our study of this situation is inspired by and has implications for
Ramsey theory. We 
prove that for a class of monoids strictly extending the class of R-trivial monoids
such actions always 
embed a finite configuration defined from the monoid only. This result, through
ultrafilter methods, implies 
Ramsey theoretic statements; for example, it gives a new proof of the
Furstenberg--Katznelson Ramsey 
theorem. It also makes it possible to define a notion of Ramsey monoid and give a
characterization of 
those in terms of algebraic properties of the monoid. This characterization implies a
negative answer to 
a question of Lupini on possible extensions of Gowers' Ramsey theorem. 

<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker 6:15 p.m. at ZaZa's Cucina (622 Cascadila St at Route 13). 
<br><br>
Note the speaker will also be giving the Oliver Club Lecture on Thursday.
<br><br><br>
Tuesday, 11/8: <i>A minimal predicative framework for formalizing mathematics </i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Liron Cohen</strong>, Computer Science Department, Cornell University<br><br>
<br><br>
Abstract: We describe a framework for formalizing mathematics which is based on the usual set
theoretical foundations of mathematics. Its most important feature is that it
reflects real mathematical practice as presented in ordinary mathematical discourse
by making extensive use of abstract set terms. We show how large portions of
scientifically applicable mathematics can be developed in this framework in a
straightforward way, using just rather weak predicative systems and their
corresponding minimal universes. The key property of those theories is that every
object which is used in it is defined by some closed term of the theory. This allows
for a very concrete, computationally-oriented interpretation.

<br><br>
Wednesday, 11/9: <i>How hard is it to compute homogeneous sets for colorings?</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jun Le Goh</strong>, Cornell University <br>
<br><br>
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that for every coloring of n-tuples,
there is an infinite set H which is homogeneous, i.e., all of the n-tuples
in H have the same color. In 1972, Jockusch showed that as the size of
tuples increases, it becomes harder to compute infinite homogeneous sets.
What if we fix the size of tuples but increase the number of colors? Would
that make it harder to compute infinite homogeneous sets? We present
results of Patey which say yes, and more. Knowledge of reducibilities will
not be assumed.
<br><br><br><br>
Tuesday, 11/15: <i>$\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ in every real in a $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ class of reals
is $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Richard A. Shore</strong>, Cornell University<br><br>
Abstract: 
We first prove a theorem about reals (subsets of $\mathbb{N}$) and classes
of
reals: If a real $X$ is $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ in every member $G$ of a nonempty
$\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ class $\mathcal{K}$ of reals then $X$ is itself $\Sigma
_{1}^{1}$. We also explore the relationship between this theorem, various
basis results in hyperarithmetic theory and omitting types theorems in
several generalized and modal logics. We then prove the analog of our first theorem for 
classes of
reals: If a class $\mathcal{A}$ of reals is $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ in every member
of a nonempty $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$ class $\mathcal{B}$ of reals then
$\mathcal{A}$ is itself $\Sigma_{1}^{1}$.<br><br>
 This is joint work with T. Slaman and L. Harrington
 
<br><br>
Wednesday, 11/16: <i>On the uniform computational content of Ramsey's theorem I</i><br>
&nbsp; <strong>Iian Smythe</strong>,  Cornell University <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>

Tuesday, 11/22: <i>\(\epsilon_0\) and Richard Thompson's group F</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Justin Moore</strong>, Cornell University <br><br>

Abstract: The purpose of this talk will be to demonstrate the existence of a well ordered chain
of length \(\epsilon_0 + 1\) in the finitely generated subgroups of Richard
Thompson's group F.  This requires the development of an apparently novel way of
representing the ordinal \(\epsilon_0\).
This is joint work with Collin Bleak and Matt Brin.

This talk will be preceded by a closely related talk the same day in the topology
seminar (1:30pm, 207 Malott).  The talks are structured so as not to require
knowledge from the other talk.  The topology seminar talk with, however, spend more
time motivating the main result and explaining group theoretic aspects of the
construction.

Tuesday, 11/29: <i>Some Remarks on Quantum Logic, the Kochen-Specker Theorem and Entanglement</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Howard Blair</strong>,  EE & CS Syracuse University<br><br>

Abstract: I will present an overview of the Kochen-Specker theorem along with a
characterization of entanglement 
in a multi-partite pure quantum state that uses multi-dimensional arrays to exhibit
all of the possible separations of the state.
