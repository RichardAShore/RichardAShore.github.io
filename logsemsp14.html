<h1>Logic seminar 
<br>
Spring 2014</h1><br>



<br>
<br>

The topic for this semester will be hyperarithemtic theory for both sets of numbers and sets of reals. 
The later is really effective descriptive set theory into which we will make only an 
introductory foray.
<p>
With this view in mind the basic reference (for which chapter and section references in titles
refer) is

Abstract:

Let N be the set of natural numbers.  We consider explicit and
implicit first-order definability over the structure (N,+,x,=).  Let
N^N be the Baire space, i.e., the space of total functions X : N -> N.
A point X in N^N is said to be explicitly definable if 
X = {(i,j) in N x N | (N,+,x,=) satisfies Phi(i,j)} for some
first-order formula Phi(i,j).  More generally, for X, Y in N^N we say
that X is explicitly definable from Y if X = {(i,j) in N x N |
(N,+,x,=,Y) satisfies Phi(i,j,Y)} for some first-order formula
Phi(i,j,Y).  A subset P of N^N is said to be explicitly definable if P
= {X in N x N | (N,+,x,=,X) satisfies Psi(X)} for some first-order
formula Psi(X).  Note that a point X or a set P is explicitly
definable if and only if it is arithmetical, i.e., Pi^0_n for some n
in N.  A point X in N^N is said to be implicitly definable or
implicitly arithmetical or an arithmetical singleton if the singleton
set {X} is arithmetical.
<br><br>
The Tarski Truth Theorem provides an example of a point which is
implicitly definable but not explicitly definable.  The Kleene/Souslin
Theorem implies that a point is hyperarithmetical if and only if it is
explicitly definable from some implicitly definable point.  Cohen
forcing provides an implicitly definable pair of points such that
neither point is implicitly definable.  A 1972 theorem of H. Tanaka
says that every countable, nonempty, explicitly definable set of
points contains an implicitly definable point.  A 1975 theorem of
Harrington provides a pair of implicitly definable points such that
neither point is explicitly definable from the other.  A 1976 theorem
of Harrington provides a countable, explicitly definable set of points
such that not every point in the set is implicitly definable.  The
proofs of Harrington's theorems involve a remarkable application of
the Recursion Theorem.

Tuesday, 2/25: <i>On the cost of generating an inner amenable group</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Robin Tucker-Drob</strong>, Rutgers University<br>
<br>
Abstract: I will discuss recent results on structural properties of groups
which possess an atomless inner invariant mean, and I will show how these
properties imply that all free measure preserving actions of ICC inner
amenable groups have cost 1.

There will be a dinner with the speaker after the seminar.

<br><br>
Tuesday, 3/4: <i>Strong reductions between combinatorial problems</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Damir Dzafarov</strong>, University of Connecticut, Storrs<br>
<br><br>
Abstract: I will discuss recent investigations of various reducibility notions
between Pi^1_2 principles of second-order arithmetic, the most familiar of which is
implication over the subsystem RCA_0. In many cases, such an implication is actually
due to a considerably stronger reduction holding, such as a uniform (a.k.a.
Weihrauch) reduction. (Here, we say a principle P is uniformly reducible to a
principle Q if there are fixed reduction procedures Phi and Gamma such that for
every instance A of P, Phi(A) is an instance of Q, and for every solution S to
Phi(A), Gamma(A + S) is a solution to A.) As an example, nearly all the implications
between principles lying below Ramsey's theorem for pairs are uniform reductions. In
general, the study of when such stronger implications hold and when they do not
gives a finer way of calibrating the relative strength of mathematical propositions.
In addition, this analysis sheds light on several open questions from reverse
mathematics, including that of whether the stable form of Ramsey's theorem for pairs
(SRT^2_2) implies the cohesive principle (COH) in \omega (standard) models of RCA_0.

Wednesday, 3/5:  <i>Hypearithmetic reducibility and the Hyperjump;  Basis Theorems, 
(II.5,7, III.1)</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Jamie Barnes and Wu Wei</strong>, Cornell University 
<br><br>
Tuesday, 3/11: <i>Strongly minimal theories with computable models, A Lecture in Memory of Vivienne Morley</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Julia Knight</strong>, Notre Dame<br>
<br><br>
Abstract:  I will describe joint work with Uri Andrews showing that for a strongly
minimal theory $T$, if the $\exists_{n+3}$ part of $T$ is $\Delta^0_n$, uniformly
in $n$, then all models of $T$ have computable copies.  Relativizing this, we
obtain the fact that if a strongly minimal theory has a computable model, then all
models have $\Delta^0_5$ copies.  We hope to replace $\Delta^0_5$ by $\Delta^0_4$.
The talk will include background on strongly minimal theories.  I hope to say
enough about the proof to make clear how it combines serious model theory (Morley
rank and degree) with serious computability (constructions by infinitely many workers). 
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the seminar.
<br><br>
Wednesday, 3/12:  <i>Unique notations and Hyperarithmetic quantifiers(III.2-3)</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Wu Wei</strong>, Cornell University 
<br><br>
Tuesday, 3/18: <i>Paths, trees, and the computational strength of some Ramsey-type theorems</i> <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Steven Flood</strong>, University of Connecticut, Storrs<br>
<br><br>
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that each coloring has an infinite homogeneous set, 
but these sets can be arbitrarily spread out.  Paul Erdos and Fred Galvin proved that 
for each coloring $f$, there is an infinite set that is ``packed together'' which is 
given ``a small number'' of colors by $f$.  <br>

In this talk, we will give the precise statement of this packed Ramsey's theorem, 
and discuss its computational and reverse mathematical strength.  
<br>
We will also discuss a related combinatorial principle called $\mathsf{RKL}$ 
which combines features of Weak Konig's Lemma and Ramsey's Theorem.  We will give a 
precise statement of this principle and two of its generalizations, and discuss 
their reverse mathematical strength.
<br><br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the seminar.

Tuesday, 4/8: <i>Every action of a non-amenable group is the factor of a small action</i> <br>
<strong>Brandon Seward</strong>, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
<br>
There will be a dinner with the speaker after the seminar.
<br><br>
Abstract: It is well known that if G is a countable amenable group and the
action of G on (Y, \nu) factors onto the action of G on (X, \mu), then the
entropy of the first action must be greater than or equal to the entropy of
the second action. In particular, if the action of G on (X, \mu) has
infinite entropy then the action of G on (Y, \nu) does not admit any finite
generating partition. In this talk, I will show that this completely fails
for actions of non-amenable groups. Specifically, if G is a countable
non-amenable group then there exists a finite integer n with the following
property: for every pmp action of G on (X, \mu) there is a G-invariant
probability measure \nu on n^G such that the action of G on (n^G, \nu)
factors onto the action of G on (X, \mu). For many non-amenable groups, n
can be chosen to be 4 or smaller. We also obtain a similar result for
continuous actions on compact metric spaces and continuous factor maps.

Tuesday 5/6: <i>Input/output machines and injection structures</i>
 <br>
&nbsp; <strong>Mia Minnes</strong>, UCSD.
<br><br>
Abstract: An injection structure is presented by a finite-state transducer
if its domain is a regular set of  strings and its injection is realized by
a finite-state transducer (deterministic input-output automaton).  In this
talk, I will present recent joint work with Jeff Remmel and Doug Center
studying FST injection structures, characterizing all those over a unary
alphabet, and comparing them to computable injection structures.
